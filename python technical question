1. Unit Testing?
It is module level testing. Focus on individual components or function of your code is working or not.
How it works:
Use assert statements to check if the actual value equals the expected value.
Example: assert actual_value == expected_value
Purpose: 
1.Ensure each part of code working as expected
2.Catch bugs early in development stage
3.Write test case function prefixed with test_function_name and run using pytest command
Run command: pytest/pytest test_file_name.py/pytest test_file.py::test_function_name
Framework Used: Pytest framework or Unittest inbuilt library

2. What is conftest.py?
conftest.py is a special configuration file used in Pytest.
There is set of function can be written added in fixture, it can be run before every test case when its initialize.

3. Integration Testing?
It is the combination of mutiple modules working together correctly.
Integration testing is the process of testing how multiple modules or components work together as a group. 
It ensures that the interactions between different parts of the system function correctly.
Framework Used: Pytest framework

4. Generators in python?
It looks like a normal function. But we using yield keyword instead of return statement.
Advantange more memeory efficient compared to list
Because do not store entire sequence of values in memeory all at once. Instead of generate a value only one at a time.
Genrates a value using next() function in generator

data = [1, 2, [3], [4, [5, 6]]]

def flatten(nested):
    for item in nested:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            yield from flatten(item)
        else:
            yield item

print(list(flatten(data)))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

5. Decorator in python?
Add funtionality to function or class without modifying their original code.

Rate Limiting: Limiting the api http request.
Prevents too many calls in a short time, protecting APIs or servers from overload.

from ratelimiter import RateLimiter

@RateLimiter(max_calls=10, period=1)
def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")

This allows 10 calls per second. If exceeded, it delays execution

6. Middleware?
Process of request and response intercepts globally before they reach the route or after leave the route.
Commonly used in logging, hanlde authentication, security and secure management.
You can listed middleware in the middleware settings in settings.py

key difference:
Middleware:
used in application level
intercepts and process the http request
configure in settings.py or app startup
Decorator:
used in functional level
add behaviour to function
using @decorator_name

import time

def simple_decorator(f):
	def wrapper(*args, ** kwargs):
		print(time.time())
		result = f(*args, **kwargs)
		print(time.time())
		return result
	return wrapper
	

@simple_decorator
def func_name(*args):
	a = sum(args)
	return a

print(func_name(1,2,3,4))

9. *args, **kwargs in python?
*args non keyword arguments
Meaning: Collects positional (non-keyword) arguments into a tuple.
Use case: When you don’t know how many number of arguments passed to a function 
that time using args
def add_numbers(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10

**kwargs keyword arguments
Meaning: Collects keyword arguments into a dictionary.
Use case:When you don’t know how many keyword arguments will be passed.
def print_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Alice", age=25, city="Chennai")


10. Python memory manager?
Python memeory manager primarily handled by private heap space.
You create python object like dict or list memeory is allocated from this private heap space.
Python memory manager handles the allocation and deallocation of memeory for those objects.
But some cycles of memeory is running in background. The garbage collector identifies these cycles and 
free the memeory spaces.

11. Multithreading?
Execution of multi threads concurrently with same time.
In python GIL executes single threads at a time even on mutiple cpu core.
As the result multithreading does not perform on cpu bound task due to GIL.
So where threads spend amount of time waiting in i/o opertion, other threads are scheduled to executed

Async is best for I/O task (API/DB calls)
Thread help with background task or CPU-heavy task.

12. Multiprocessing?
Multiprocessing means running many processes at the same time, each on its own CPU core.
Unlike multithreading, it avoids Python’s GIL, so it’s best for CPU-bound tasks like heavy calculations or data processing.
Real-Time Examples of Multiprocessing:
Image and Video Processing
Editing or filtering thousands of images in parallel.
Rendering video frames across multiple CPU cores to speed up processing.

13. Shallow copy?
A shallow copy creates a new object that references the same elements as the original list. 
If you change those elements, the original list will also be affected.
Use copy.copy() method
14. Deep copy?
It is create new object but original list will not be affected.
Use copy.deepcopy() method

import copy
Shallow copy:
original_list = [1,2,[3,4]]
copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)
copied_list[2].append(5)
print(original_list) # [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]
print(copied_list) #[1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]
Deep copy:
original_list = [1,2,[3,4]]
copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
copied_list[2].append(5) 
print(original_list) #[1, 2, [3, 4]]
print(copied_list) #[1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]

15. Synchronus function:
A synchronous function is a normal function where each operation runs one after another.
It blocks execution until the current task is finished.

16. Asynchrous function:
An asynchronous function is defined with the async keyword and executed asynchronously it means dont have wait around each operation. 
For example, if many operations are running in the background and the first one takes time, 
the second can run immediately, while the first continues and finishes later.

17. List Comphrension:
Create a list based on existing iterables.
my_list = [1,2,3]
square = [num * num for num in my_list]
print(square)
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
even_number = [num for num in my_list if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_number)

18. Lambda:
It is anonyms function using lambda keyword. Taking any number of arguments only one expression having
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))

19. map() function
It is used to apply function to every item in iterable and return new map object. You can convert this result to list.
Use case: 
More memory efficient than using for loops
easily combine with lambda

data = [1,2,3,4]
x = lambda a: a *2
print(list(map(x,data)))

list1 = [1,2,3]
list = [4,5,6]
print(list(map(lambda a,b : a+b, list1, list2)))

20. zip() function?
zip function takes iterables and aggregates them in tuple and return it
list1 = [1,2,3]
list = [4,5,6]
c = [a+b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]

21. Sonar lint
Scope: Works inside your IDE
Used for Individual developers
SonarLint is a static code analysis tool.
It integrates directly into your IDE.
Its main purpose is to detect and highlight code quality issues and security vulnerabilities while you write code — so you can fix them immediately.
SonarQube:
Scope: Runs on a your server (self-hosted).
Used for Teams/organizations

22. Pass does nothing
Break is for breaking the loop execution
Continue is for skipping the value of loop iteration.

23. Code optimization:
1. Indexing in sql
Used to improve the speed up the data retreival operation on a database.
Enchance the query speed make insert, update query will takes longer
Create INDEX index_name on table_name(col);
Drop INDEX index_name on table_name(col);
2. Removing Unwanted Subqueries (Using Joins Instead)
3. Using Lambda and Map Functions Instead of For Loops (Python)
4. Redis caching server
Redis acts as a high‑speed in‑memory cache that stores API responses, so repeated requests are served instantly without hitting the database.
When get api is called, we store the response in a cache server like redis. next time when the same request comes, we return
data from cache instead of calling the database again
Advantage: Reduce db load, improves api performance

24. oops(object oriented programming language)
creating objects that contain both data and behaviour
it is create modular, reusable and maintainable code.

1. Encapsulation:
the methods that works on data within a single unit can prevent the accidental modification of data and used for
security purpose
1. protect variable: declared before variable name single underscore
can be accessed within a class and subclass
2. private variable:  declared before variable name double underscore
cannot accessed outside of class nor base class

2. Abstraction:
Hiding complex details and exposing only essential feature of an object
It serves as  a blueprint for other class
Abstract class added in base class must be used in dervied class

from abc import ABC , abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand
        
    @abstractmethod
    def startengine1(self):
        pass
    
    # @abstractmethod
    # def startengine2(self):
    #     pass
    
    
class Car(Vehicle):
    def startengine1(self):
        return f"{self.brand} car's engine started"
    
car = Car('Exter')
print(car.startengine1())

ABC used for serves blueprint for other classes
vehicle = Vehicle() this will raise error because you cannot intitate abstract class


3. Polymorphism:
Different object respond the same method or function call in different ways of approach.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def startengine1(self):
        pass
    
class Car(Vehicle):
    def startengine1(self):
        return f"{self.brand} car's engine started"
        
class Bike(Vehicle):
    def startengine1(self):
        return f"{self.brand} bike's engine started"
    
vehicles = [Car("Exter"), Bike("Suzuki")]
for vehicle in vehicles:
    print(vehicle.startengine1())
    
4. Inheritance:
Inheritance are inherits the properties of base class to dervied class

i) Single inheritance:
single inheritance are inherits the properties from only one parent class to child class.

ii) multiple inheritance:
inherits from more than one base class. Like parent 1, parent 2 inherits to child class.

iii) multilevel inheritance:
a class inherits from a parent class and then another class inherits from the dervied class.
Like grandfather, parent(grandfather), child(parent)

iv) hierarchical inheritance:
multiple classes inherits from a common parent class.
Like: Animal, Cat(Animal), Dog(Animal)

25. Constructor:
It is called special method or magical method for class __init__() method. Used to initialize the new object
and automatically create instance of class


26. super() method
used to call the parent class from the child class. within child class we need initialize the super method
access the attributes from the parent class

27. i) instance method:
it is normal method
it takes self as first argument
it works with object

ii) class method
it takes cls as first argument
access the class variable
@classmethod decorator is used here
this method can be called using class

iii) static method 
does not take any specific parameter
cannot access the class variable or instance variable
@staticmethod decorator is used here 
this method can be called using class as well

class Employee:
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
    def show_details(self):
        return f"Employee name {self.name} and age {self.age}"
    
    company_name = "HTL"
    
    @classmethod
    def get_company_name(cls):
        return f"Company name {cls.company_name}."
        
    @staticmethod
    def greeting():
        return "Welcome"
        

emp1 = Employee("Gowtham", 30)
print(Employee.greeting())
print(Employee.get_company_name())
print(emp1.show_details())


28. Authentication:(who you are)
process of verifying user indentity to ensure that person valid or not. 
using username and password. once indentity confirmed,they can access the login page 

29. Authorization: control permission(what you can do)
what actions authenticate user is allowed to access

30. Git and Github:
Git -- version control system
Purpose: Helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate efficiently, and maintain history.

Github --  cloud-based platform
remote storage for git respositories
ci/cd integration for automation using via github action runner
code review and access control

31. range function
generates sequence of numbers. it creates a range object that represents sequence of numbers
between start vaule and end value

32. postive indexing:
starts from 0 for the first element in sequence. way to accessing elements in python
negative indexing:
starts from -1 for the last elements in sequence.

33. SQL alchemy: Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
sql alchemy is an orm. it provides a way to interact with database and manage transaction 
Use case: Using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.
It also manages connections, transactions, and schema definitions automatically.

34. Sub Query:
Sub Query is known as the nested query or inner query a query nested with another query.
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM user
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM user
);

35. Joins
Combine Records from one or more tables.
i) Inner Joins
Return only matched records from both the tables 
ii) Left joins
Return all records from left table and matched records from right table.
iii)Right Join
Returns all records from right table and matched records from left table.
iv)Full join or Full Outer Join
Returns all the records from match in left or right table, when unmatched records return in null values.

36. views in sql:
View cannot have index
It is virtual table based on the result set of and sql statement
A view is created with the create view statement
Usecase: Instead of writing a long query mutiple times, you can store in view and select * from view_name;

create VIEW user_sal_view as 
select 
u.user_name,
u.user_id,
s.ctc,
from
user u
join
salary s
on
u.user_id = s.user_id;

select * from user_sal_view;

37. Second highest salary from user table
select salary 
from user
order by salary desc
limit 1
offset 1; --> skip the first row


38. To find duplicate value in SQL table:
select col_name, COUNT(*) as count
from table_name
group by col_name
having count(*) >1;

39. Foreign key is a constraint used to link two tables together
parent table : contains primary key to which fk refers
child table: the table contains the foriegn key

40. Primary key consists of single column
A composite key is a primary key made up of multiple columns. Mainly used for many many relationship
one student purchase many course
one course can purchased by many students

41. Monolithic:
Tightly coupled and run as a single service. All are interconnected service
Simple to develop and deploy (good for small applications).
Microservice:
A collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over web protocols like rest apis
Good for large, scalable systems.
Each service has its own codebase and can be deployed independently.
Advantage: failure in one service doesn’t crash the whole system

42. Steps to Deploy FastAPI on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
Create an EC2 instance with Ubuntu server.
Add firewall rules to allow TCP port 22 (SSH) and port 8000 (FastAPI default).
Allow external access to ports 22, 8000, and your database port.
Clone the project to the server using Git.
Create a start.sh file that installs pip requirements and runs the application server.
Create a virtual environment.
Install Gunicorn.
Create a service file and link it to start.sh.
Use systemctl to enable the .service file.
Use systemctl to start the service.
Install Nginx (sudo apt install nginx).
Create an Nginx config file to set up reverse proxy:
Forward requests from port 88 (or 80/443 for production)
Point to your FastAPI app running on port 8000
Add your server’s IP address or domain name

43.What is a Context Manager?
A context manager in FastAPI is a way to run some code before your app starts and after your app stops.
Using @asynccontextmanager decorator in function 
It’s often used for things like:
Connecting to a database
Loading initial (seed) data
Cleaning up resources when the app shuts down

44. RestAPI?
send http request from client to server and then get a response back.
Client → Http Request → Server → Response → Client

45. What is a Router in FastAPI?
A router in FastAPI is a way to organize your API endpoints.
Instead of writing all routes in one file, you can split them into different routers (like user routes, product routes, etc.) and then include them in your main app.

46. Pydantic:
It is python library used for data validation and data parsing.
It defines what data the api expects (request, body, query params)
Validate the incoming data automictically
Convert data into correct datatype(like int, str)
Return data in clean and structure format.

47. Uvicorn:
It is light weight web server used to ASGI application like fastapi framework.
i) synchrous request (normal http request)
ii) Asynchrous request(websocket, background task)
WSGI limitation cannot handle webscokets, only support synchrous http request
ASGI solves can handle aynsc + sync support websocket
Webscocket are used when data must update continuously or instanly. communication protocal communicate b/w client and server single long live connection.
Both sides connection are open.
Used for live cricket score, online gaming, food delievery app(swiggy)

48:Webhooks:
It is a way of one application to sent real time data or notification to another application when specific event occurs.
Reatime example UPI payment.

49.Webscrapping
It is process of extracting data from website by fetching and parsing the HTML content.
Used for price monitoring, market analysis.
Tools: Beautiful soap, scrapy, Requests, Selenium.

50. Solve the factorial:
n = input("Enter the number: ")
fact = 1
for i in range(1, int(n)+1):
    fact *= i    
print(fact)

51. #Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller piece of the same problem.
data = [1, 2, [3], [4, [5, 6]]]

def flatten_list(nested):
    result = []
    for i in nested:
        if isinstance(i, list):
            result.extend(flatten_list(i))
        else:
            result.append(i)
    return result
print(flatten_list(data))

52.
words = ["to", "python", "go", "word"]
o/p:{2: ['to', 'go'], 6: ['python'], 4: ['word']}
words_count = {}

for word in words:
    words_count[word] = len(word)

res = {}

for keys, values in words_count.items():
    if values in res:
        res[values].append(keys)
    else:
        res[values] = [keys]

print(res)

53.
PyTorch
Definition: PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework created by Meta (Facebook AI Research).
Used in Machine learning pipelines and AI features.
Purpose: It helps developers and researchers build and train neural networks easily.
Key point: Known for being flexible and “Pythonic,” making it popular in both research and industry.
Usecases:
Speech and audio processing
Natural language processing (text classification, translation, chatbots)
A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by how the human brain works. 
It’s made up of layers of connected “neurons” (mathematical functions) that process data and learn patterns.

Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computer systems to learn patterns from datasets 
and make predictions or decisions without programmed by humans.

Deep Learning
Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers that can automatically learn complex patterns from 
raw data like images, sound, and text. It’s used in applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

54.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Definition: NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, 
and generate human language (text or speech).
Examples: Chatbots, translation apps, voice assistants, sentiment analysis.

55.

56.
How do you handle failure?
Proper error handling, retries, timeouts and logging 

57.
How do you secure APIs?
JWT authentication, input validation, role base access control and HTTPS

58.
Streamlit
It is used to quickly build UI dashboards

59.
Matplotlib and Seaborn
It is used for data visualization

60. CORS stands for Cross‑Origin Resource Sharing.
It’s a browser security mechanism that allows a web application running on 
one origin (domain, protocol, or port) to request resources from another origin
When the application is running, the backend communicates with the frontend. At that time, we were getting CORS errors.
To fix this, we integrated CORS middleware into the app’s middleware settings.
In the development environment, we used allow_origins="*" to permit all domains.
In production, we restricted allow_origins to only the frontend URL and IP address.
